Ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence can act like a doctor? ðŸ¤” In this project, I built an AI-powered Healthcare Chatbot that predicts diseases from your symptoms using Machine Learning in Python, and I integrated it with a web interface so anyone can interact with it online! ðŸš‘ðŸ’»

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll see in this end-to-end project:
âœ… Symptom extraction with NLP â€“ understand what the user inputs
âœ… Training a Machine Learning model â€“ Random Forest Classifier for disease prediction
âœ… Interactive chatbot interface â€“ asks follow-up questions dynamically
âœ… Disease prediction with confidence scores â€“ know how likely a disease is
âœ… Health tips, precautions, and motivational advice â€“ for a complete experience
âœ… Web integration â€“ deploy your AI solution for real-time interactions

âœ¨ Learning outcomes:

Collect, clean, and preprocess medical datasets

Train ML models for symptom-based disease detection

Build a chatbot that interacts like a real healthcare assistant

Deploy your AI model through a simple web interface for user access

ðŸ“Œ Technologies & Tools Used:
Python | Scikit-learn | Pandas | NLP | Flask / Streamlit | HTML/CSS | Machine Learning

ðŸ’¬ Perfect for beginners, students, and ML enthusiasts who want to see a full project from scratch. By the end, youâ€™ll have a working AI chatbot deployed on the web, ready to impress in your portfolio.
